in this video I'm going to answer the top 3 questions my students ask me about python what is python  what you can do with it  and why is it so popular in other words what does it do that other programming languages don't  I thought is the world's fastest growing and most popular programming language not just amongst software engineers but also among mathematicians  data analyst  scientists  the accountants network engineers and even kids  because it's a very beginner friendly programming language  so people from different disciplines use python for a variety of different tasks such as data analysis and visualization artificial intelligence and machine learning automation in fact this is one of the big users of python amongst people who are not software developers  if you constantly have to do boring repetitive tasks such as copying files and folders around renaming them uploading them to a server you can easily write a python script to automate all that and save your time and that's just one example  if you continuously have to work with excel spreadsheets PDF CSV files download websites and parse them you can automate all that stuff with python  so you'll have to be a software developer US prices  you could be an accountant and mathematician or a scientist and use python to make your life easier  you can also use python to build web mobile and desktop applications as well as software testing or even hacking  it's a price that is a multi purpose language  not if you have some programming experience you may say what March we can do all this stuff with other programming languages so what's the big deal about hi thanks  here are a few reasons  with python you can solve complex problems in less time with fewer lines of code  here's an example  let's say we want to extract the first 3 letters of the text hello world  this is the code we have to write in C. sharp  this is how we do it in Java script  and here's how we do it in python  see how short and clean the languages and that's just the beginning  hi still makes a lot of trivial things really easy but it's simple yet powerful syntax  here are a few of the reasons why python is so popular  it's a high level language so you don't have to worry about complex tasks such as memory management like you do in see plus plus  it's cross platform which means we can build and run python applications on windows mac analytics  it has a huge community so whenever you get stuck there's someone out there to help  it has a large ecosystem of libraries frameworks and tools which means whatever you want to do it is likely that someone else has done it before because python has been around for over 20 years  so in a nut shell python is a multi purpose language with a simple clean and beginner friendly syntax  all of that means python is awesome  technically everything either with python you can do with other programming languages python simplicity and elegance has made it grow way more than other programming languages  that's why is the number one language employers are looking for  so whether you're a programmer or an absolute beginner learning python opens up lots of job opportunities to you  in fact the average price on developer earns a whopping $16000 here  if you found this review helpful please support my hard work by liking it and sharing it with others also be sure to subscribe to my channel because I have a couple of awesome python tutorials for you you're going to see them on the screen now  here's my python tutorial for beginners it's a great starting point if you have limited or no programming experience  on the other hand if you do have some programming experience I want to quickly get up to speed with python I have another tutorial chose for you  I'm not going to waste your time telling you what a variable or function is I will talk to you like a program  there's never been a better time to master hi some programming to click on the tutorial that is right for you and get started  thank you for watching
